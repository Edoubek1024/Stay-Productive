# The Extension

Once installed, users can utilize the extension's features to make their internet experience much more intentional and productive. While there are features specially crafted for four individual websites, Stay Productive can also limit access to any domain.

## Blocking Websites

The best way to avoid distractions is to remove them. That's why Stay Productive has switches to block YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and Twitter in each of their respective tabs. There is also the option to add other domains to block using the Other tab.

When a website is blocked, any attempt to access it will return to the previous website in the tab's history. If that website is the only website in the history of that tab, the extension will delete the tab entirely.

## YouTube

YouTube is a platform where users can watch videos posted by content creators or other users. The website is built in a way to keep users on the YouTube page in order to consume more content and advertisements. The following features will hopefully give users more control over the time they spend watching these videos.

</p>

#### Remove Recommended Videos

On the YouTube dashboard, users can choose to remove recommended videos. This will remove all recommended videos from the sidebar while watching videos, recommended videos at the end, as well as all videos on the homepage. This would require a link or a deliberate search to find videos, increasing the user's control over their viewing experience.

</p>

### YouTube Shorts

YouTube Shorts is a sub-platform of YouTube where creators and other users can post short form content. This short form content can be highly addictive, especially since users can easily move to the next video by scrolling downward.

#### Prevent Scrolling

On the YouTube dashboard, users can choose to prevent YouTube Shorts scrolling. This will remove the user's ability to scroll by redirecting them to the video format of that short. This is a 100% effective way of removing scrolling ability while maintaining all the interactive features of the short.

</p>

#### Remove Recommended Shorts

YouTube shorts are recommended to users differently than traditional videos, on large "shelves." Since YouTube shorts are so much more addictive and distracting compared to traditional videos, the YouTube dashboard has an option to remove these recommendation shelves.

## TikTok

TikTok is a platform where users can watch short videos posted by creators and other users. The app is designed to maximize user engagement by continually showing new content through an infinite scroll interface. This design can lead to prolonged screen time and compulsive usage. The following features aim to give users more control over the time they spend on TikTok and help reduce unnecessary distractions.

</p>

### Prevent Scrolling

On the TikTok dashboard, users can choose to prevent scrolling. This will remove the user's ability to scroll by redirecting them to the video format of that specific TikTok. This is a 100% effective way of removing scrolling ability while maintaining all the interactive features of the TikTok. This will ensure that if the user clicks a TikTok link, it will not lead directly to scrolling.

To avoid scrolling further, the Explore page is repurposed as the new home page. Any attempts to go to the home page will lead directly to the Explore page, giving the user more control.

</p>

## Instagram

Instagram is a platform where users can share and view photos, videos, and stories from creators and friends. Over time, Instagram has evolved to prioritize algorithmically recommended content, such as Reels and Explore posts, which encourages prolonged usage and passive scrolling. The following features are intended to help users take back control over their Instagram experience and reduce time spent on unintentional browsing.

</p>

#### Only Messaging

On the Instagram dashboard, users can choose to only allow messaging on Instagram. This is done by only allowing the `/direct` path on Instagram. Upon the attempt to access any other Instagram feature, users are redirected to the messaging overview page. This allows users to still have access to Instagram for communication purposes, while not being distracted by other Instagram features.

#### Prevent Recommended Posts

Should users want to limit their Instagram viewing experience, they can choose to remove recommended posts on the Instagram dashboard. This gives users more control as they are then required to search for specific content or visit profiles intentionally, rather than being fed endless posts by the Instagram algorithm. This helps reduce unintended usage and increases deliberate choices.

</p>

### Instagram Reels

Instagram Reels is a sub-platform of Instagram where users and creators can share short-form, vertical videos. This content is designed to be quickly consumed and highly engaging, with an endless scroll feature that encourages prolonged, often unintentional viewing sessions.

#### Prevent Scrolling

On the Instagram dashboard, users can choose to prevent scrolling for Instagram Reels. This is done by redirecting reels to their traditional post format. This is a 100% effective way of removing scrolling ability while maintaining all the interactive features of the reel. This decreases the likelihood that users will passively view more reels should they specifically choose to view only one.

</p>

## Twitter (also known as X)

Twitter is a platform where users can share and engage with short messages, known as tweets, from individuals, organizations, and public figures. In recent years, Twitter has increasingly emphasized algorithmically recommended content, including suggested tweets, trends, and promoted posts. These changes can lead to longer, less intentional browsing sessions. The following features aim to help users regain control of their Twitter experience and reduce time spent on passive scrolling.

</p>

#### Only Messaging

On the Twitter dashboard, users can choose to allow only messaging. This is done by only allowing the `messages` path on Twitter. Upon the attempt to access any other Twitter feature, users will be redirected to the Twitter messaging overview page. This allows users to still have access to Twitter for messaging purposes.

#### Prevent Recommended Posts

Should users want to limit their Twitter viewing experience, they can choose to remove recommended posts. This removes suggested content from their feed, helping to create a more intentional and less distracting environment.

</p>

## Other Websites

Should users want to block access to any other website, they can enter the url of a website to block that website's domain on the `Other` tab. Just like for the other four websites, this will return the user to the last unblocked domain in a tab's history or will delete the tab entirely if access is attempted. Extra blocked domains will be listed and can be removed from the block list on the `Other` tab of the extension as well.
